Instead of listing our publications, I will briefly speak about past research projects.

Members of the Robotics Lab were involved in the EU FP7 project LIREC (Living with Robots and Interactive Companions). This project investigated the long-term use of robot companions in different scenarios, e.g. in an office or at home.

We also had many undergraduate and postgraduate students working with our robots.
