Instead of listing our publications, I will briefly speak about past research projects.

Members of the Robotics Lab were involved in the EU FP7 project LIREC (Living with Robots and Interactive Companions). This project investigated the long-term use of robot companions in different scenarios, e.g. in an office or at home.

We also had many undergraduate and postgraduate students working with our robots.

For example, the NAO robot served as a helper for visually impaired people to navigate around a room. The robot would detect if there are any obstacles and they acoustically inform about the position of these obstacles.

Our e-puck robots were trained to play robot soccer. Following different strategies, two teams of e-pucks played a 3-a-side match against each other.

Our ARDrones were used in a project on non-verbal communication. Similar to the waggle dance of bees, a drone was flying a spatial pattern, e.g. a circular or a triangular pattern. Another drone could see this pattern and was able to interpret it. This form of communication is helpful if other communication types like WiFi are not available.

If you are interested in details, please ask our lab members.
