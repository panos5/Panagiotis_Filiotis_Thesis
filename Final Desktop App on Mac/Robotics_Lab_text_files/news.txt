In June, a proposal to the Converge Challenge 2015, made by our lab members Alistair McConnell, Patricia Vargas, David Corne and Adam Stokes, has been selected for the Heriot-Watt "Magnificent Seven" and will compete in the second round of the challenge.

In April, our lab received a new robot: an iCub talking head who was given the name Nikita. Nikita will learn new skills with us, for example talking, finding a focus of attention and engaging in natural interaction with humans.

On the 27th of March we organised our Robotics Lab Research Open Day. This full day workshop included presentations of our students and keynote speeches of Prof. Ruth Aylett, Prof. Angelo Cangelosi, Dr. Marc Hanheide and Dr. Micael Couceiro.
