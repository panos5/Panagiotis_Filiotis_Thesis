<p><big><b><u>About</u></b></big><br><blockquote><p>
Pygame is a cross-platfrom library designed to make it easy to write
multimedia software, such as games, in Python. Pygame requires the
Python language and SDL multimedia library. It can also make use of
several other popular libraries.
</p><p>This installer requires 32-bit python 2.7 from <a href="http://python.org">python.org</a>.
It is compatible with Mac OS X 10.3.9 and later.
</p></blockquote></p><br>

<p><big><b><u>Help</u></b></big><br><blockquote><p>
If you are just getting started with pygame, you should be able
to get started fairly quickly. Pygame comes with many tutorials
and introductions. There is also full reference documentation for
the entire library. Browse the documentation from the documenantation
index. <a href=docs/index.html>docs/index.html</a>.
<p></p>
On the pygame website, there is also an online copy of this
documentation. You should know that the online documentation stays
up to date with the development version of pygame in svn. This may
be a bit newer than the version of pygame you are using.
<p></p>
Best of all the examples directory has many
playable small programs which can get started playing with the
code right away.

This basically means you can use pygame in any project you want, but
if you make any changes or additions to pygame itself, those must be
released with a compatible license. (preferably submitted back to the
pygame project). Closed source and commercial games are fine.

The programs in the "<u>examples</u>" subdirectory are in the public domain.
