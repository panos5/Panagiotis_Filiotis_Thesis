In our lab we have four humanoid NAO robots, twenty small e-pucks and three flying
ARDrones.

There are also Nikita and Sarah. 

Nikita is an iCub robotic head and Sarah is a human-size robot with an EMYS turtle head.

We also have Pleo, an emotion-sensitive dinosaur robot, and AIBO, the robot dog.
