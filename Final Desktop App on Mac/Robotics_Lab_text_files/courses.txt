The aim of this course is to introduce students to concepts and techniques used in robotics and applications ranging from industrial automation to robotic companions. It will discuss basic concepts used in evolutionary, swarm and other bio-inspired robotics. Furthermore, it will present theoretical background on developmental robotics and human-robot interaction.

The first lecturer is Patricia Vargas who covers subjects related to Behaviour Based , Evolutionary and Swarm Robotics.

The second lecturer is Nick Taylor who specializes on Manipulator Kinematics, Inverse Kinematics , Velocity, Path Control, AGV Navigation and Mapping.

The third lecturer of the course is Katrin Lohan who teaches subjects related to Developmental Robotics, Human-Robot Interaction and Embodiment.
